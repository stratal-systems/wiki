# Minicycle

Minicycle is a webhook-based CI/CD server that was
developed for use during [Gateau development](gateau-cicd.md).
It is deployed (kind of) on [Mitakihara](mitakihara.md),
and the source code and (some) documentation is available
[on github](https://github.com/stratal-systems/minicycle-rs).
There is also a `minicycle-rs` image on the [Docker Registry](registry.md).
