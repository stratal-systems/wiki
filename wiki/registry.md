# Docker Registry

STRATAL SYSTEMS operates a
[Docker registry](https://distribution.github.io/distribution/) at
<https://reg.stratal.systems>
in order to distribute containers to clients and build servers.

The registry can be accessed in read-only mode with
the username and password `public`.
If you believe you should have write access to the registry,
