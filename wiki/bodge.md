# Bodge

As promised to Arend, here is the STRATAL SYSTEMS WIKI page
on the wonderful and very versatile word "Bodge".

What is a "bodge" exactly?
As Arend first thought,
it's not a missspelling of "botch".
Although the etymological connection
[is there](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bodge),
it goes back to the old-english meaning of "botch"
as a unit of measurement equal to half a "peck".
Huh, who woulda thunk.

The semantic connection of a job poorly done
is also there,
but it's not quite what "bodge" means either.

So, what does it mean?
I'd say a bodge is a type of hack that is particularly
hasty and goal-oriented,
with less emphasis on hack value or lulz.
A bodge is similar to a kludge and probably
involves copious jank in both its implementation and user experience,
but may nevertheless outlive many "serious" solutions.
A bodge may be simple and obvious,
as well as slightly cursed,
but never as cursed as the some of the "industry standard"
solutions out there.
A bodge is not a botched job because if something is botched
it fails utterly, but a bodge may work well.
The bodge is a form of art
that always exists in a context;
one never bodges a vacuum,
but bodges *something* together,
or props up *something* with a quick
bodge.
Bodging lends itself well to computer science and engineering,
given that the original sin behind both of those fields --
[tricking rocks into doing math by zapping them with lightning](https://jakec007.github.io/2020-06-28-how-we-trick-rocks-to-think/)
--
is essentially one big bodge.
But bodges can be found in all aspects of life,
from art to science and to everyday things like propping up a table leg
with a folded piece of cardboard.

Anyway,
there's that.
